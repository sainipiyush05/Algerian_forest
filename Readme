# 🌲 Forest Fire Prediction 🔥

A machine learning-based system that predicts the risk of forest fires using environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall. The project aims to support early detection and proactive prevention of forest fires.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages a dataset of Algerian forest fires to build a predictive model that can classify whether a fire is likely to occur. It also includes a web interface for user interaction using Flask.

## 🧠 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed Algerian forest fire dataset
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Classification using machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Flask-based web application for fire risk prediction
- User-friendly interface for data input and prediction

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Algerian Forest Fires Dataset
- **Attributes**: Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind, Rain, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, Classes (Fire/Not Fire)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (for front-end)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sainipiyush05/forest_fire.git
   cd forest_fire
✅ Model Accuracy
The final model achieves high classification accuracy and performs well on test data using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
